# Fixing fine-tuning notebook from Prompt Engineering for Vision Models DeepLearning.AI course
There is a great course on Vision Models with an example of how to fine-tune stable diffusion model to generate images of a given person.
You can find it here: https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/prompt-engineering-for-vision-models/lesson/6/fine-tuning
Unfortunately when you want to reproduce it it fails because of bugs in commented code.

Here are the relevant discussions on the community forum:

https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/has-anyone-been-successful-at-running-l5-on-their-own-images-on-google-colab/677613/2

In this repository we try to fix it step by step.
